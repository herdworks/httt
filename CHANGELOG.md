* Added `version.go` with `hypertemplates.LibVersion` and `hypertemplates.LibReleaseDate` properties
* Update `github.com/herdworks/hyperfeed-go` package to v0.19.1

> **NOTE:** until now the `github.com/herdworks/hypertemplates-go` package has attempted to stay in sync with the full suite of HyperTexting packages: 
> 
> * `hypergraph-go`
> * `hyperfeed-go`
> * `hypertemplates-go`
> * `hyperproviders-go`
> * `hypertexting-go`
> * `hyperctl`
> * `libhypertexting`
> * `HyperTextingKit`
> * `hypertexting-app`
> 
> Starting with this release we will decouple the library package versions from the user-facing app versions. 

## v0.18.1 (2026-03-01)

* Fixed a bug in `theme.Archive()` that failed to include the `theme.json` config file in the theme archive.

## v0.18.0 (2026-02-26)

* Added regular expression conditionals for `ht-if` and `ht-not` parameters via the `~=` operator.
* Added `ht-offset` and `ht-limit` attributes for offsetting and limiting `ht-template` iteration output.
* Added `ht-attr` support (including multiple `ht-attr` attributes on a single element) alongside `ht-attrs`.
* Added `Theme.Archive()` and `Theme.FilePaths()` for packaging themes as `.zip` archives.
* Added theme data support via `Theme.TemplateData`, `ThemeConfig.DataDirectory`, and `Theme.DataDir()`.
* Added `ThemeConfig.FragmentsDirectory` and `Theme.FragmentsDir()` with a default `fragments` directory.
* Added markdown word counting helpers and exposed `wordcount` in parsed markdown template data.
* Added `TemplateData.Exists()` for key-path existence checks across scalars, maps, slices, and nil values.
* Added support for "static" page content files (for example `content/**/index.html`).
* Added HTML template data parsing for `.html` inputs (`title`, `description`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`).
* Changed `ht-block` fragment template data to use the `block.*` namespace (including `block.content`).
* Changed include and block attribute forwarding to target the first renderable fragment node without tag-name matching.
* Changed theme archive output to include empty configured theme directories even when they contain no files.
* Changed theme metadata default `Name`/`Version` values.
* Changed theme type names from `HyperTheme` and `HyperThemeConfig` to `Theme` and `ThemeConfig`.
* Changed standard feed parsing to use `github.com/herdworks/hyperfeed-go` (including OPML support).
* Fixed `TemplateData.SetPathValue()` recursion for nested `map[string]any` key-path updates.
* Fixed `ht-template` `ht.index` and `ht.count` property setters when composing nested template data.
* Removed the in-repo `opml` and `atom` packages in favor of `github.com/herdworks/hyperfeed-go`.
* Removed the bundled `bootstrap` package in favor of `github.com/hypertexting-go/bootstrap`.
